# Action Selector Implementation Recommendations

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Start with implementing the context and storage service
2. Add basic UI components without advanced features
3. Focus on data flow and state management

### Phase 2: UI Components
1. Implement basic selection interface
2. Add category grouping
3. Implement persistence

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
1. Add search functionality
2. Implement bulk selection
3. Add keyboard navigation

## Recommended Tools

1. State Management:
   - Use React Context for global state
   - Local storage for persistence
   - Tanstack Query for data synchronization

2. UI Components:
   - Radix UI Popover for selection interface
   - Radix UI ScrollArea for scrolling
   - Tailwind for styling

3. Performance:
   - React.memo for expensive renders
   - Debounced storage updates
   - Virtualized lists if needed

## Risks and Mitigations

1. Performance:
   - Risk: Slow updates with many actions
   - Mitigation: Memoization and optimized renders

2. Data Loss:
   - Risk: Storage corruption
   - Mitigation: Validation and fallback defaults

3. UX Issues:
   - Risk: Complex selection interface
   - Mitigation: Clear categorization and search

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests:
   - Context behavior
   - Storage operations
   - Selection logic

2. Integration Tests:
   - Component interactions
   - Storage persistence
   - State synchronization

3. E2E Tests:
   - Complete user flows
   - Cross-browser compatibility

## Development Phases

### Week 1: Foundation
1. Set up context and storage
2. Create basic UI components
3. Implement core selection logic

### Week 2: Enhancement
1. Add search and filtering
2. Implement categories
3. Add persistence

### Week 3: Polish
1. Add animations
2. Improve accessibility
3. Performance optimization

## Success Metrics

1. Performance:
   - < 100ms selection updates
   - < 50ms render time
   - < 16kb storage size

2. User Experience:
   - < 3 clicks for common tasks
   - Clear feedback
   - Intuitive navigation

3. Code Quality:
   - 90%+ test coverage
   - No TypeScript errors
   - Clean architecture

## Next Steps

1. Immediate Actions:
   - Review and approve architecture
   - Set up component structure
   - Create initial context

2. Short Term:
   - Implement basic UI
   - Add storage service
   - Basic testing

3. Medium Term:
   - Add enhanced features
   - Performance optimization
   - Complete testing

## Future Considerations

1. Features:
   - Custom ordering
   - Presets
   - Sync across devices

2. Performance:
   - Virtual scrolling
   - Worker-based filtering
   - Compressed storage

3. UX:
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Touch optimization
   - Accessibility improvements

## Dependencies

1. Required:
   - @radix-ui/react-popover
   - @radix-ui/react-scroll-area
   - @tanstack/react-query

2. Optional:
   - react-virtual (if needed)
   - @radix-ui/react-select
   - use-debounce

## Final Recommendations

1. Start Simple:
   - Basic selection first
   - Add features incrementally
   - Test thoroughly

2. Focus on UX:
   - Clear feedback
   - Fast responses
   - Intuitive design

3. Monitor Performance:
   - Track metrics
   - Profile regularly
   - Optimize early
